### Hi there, I'm Can TÃ¼resinðŸ‘‹ 

I'm  MSc student in Cryptography at Middle East Technical University, working at Fame Crypt as a researcher since 2018. I have a growing interest on cryptanalysis -especially on statistical attacks on block ciphers and SPN networks. I have been studying on cryptanalysis using automated tools for my thesis. I'm going to upload my implementations here after I make some progress related to this topic.
